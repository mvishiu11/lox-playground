# **CoreLox Language Overview**

CoreLox implements a **minimal yet powerful** subset of Lox. You can declare variables, write functions, run loops, do conditionals, and more. Below, we’ll walk through the **key keywords and constructs** you’ll use day to day.

---

## 1. **Variables: `var`**

Use `var` to declare a variable. You can optionally initialize it:

```lox
var x = 10;
print x; // 10

var y;    // declared, but defaults to nil if not assigned
y = 42;
print y; // 42
```

In CoreLox, variables are dynamically typed—so you can store strings, numbers, booleans, or even function references in them.

---

## 2. **Functions: `fun`**

Define a function with `fun`, followed by a name and parameter list. The **function** body is a **block** enclosed in braces:

```lox
fun greet(name) {
  print "Hello, " + name;
}

greet("World"); // prints "Hello, World"
```

Inside function bodies, you can declare locals with `var`, call other functions, etc. All parameters are passed by value. You can `return` from anywhere in the function (see below).

---

## 3. **If / Elif / Else: `if`, `elif`, `else`**

**CoreLox** allows more flexible conditionals than some Lox variants, thanks to `elif`. The standard form is:

```lox
if (condition) {
  // ...
} elif (anotherCondition) {
  // ...
} else {
  // ...
}
```

You can nest these however you like:

```lox
var x = 15;
if (x < 10) {
  print "x is under 10";
} elif (x < 20) {
  print "x is under 20";
} else {
  print "x is 20 or more";
}
```

> **Tip**: `elif` is basically `else if` but more convenient in some syntax rules.

---

## 4. **While Loops: `while`**

Loop while a condition is true. Usually you’ll increment a variable:

```lox
var i = 0;
while (i < 3) {
  print "i is " + i;
  i = i + 1;
}
```

---

## 5. **For Loops: `for`**

CoreLox also supports a C-style `for` statement. The EBNF reveals something like:

```lox
for (var i = 0; i < 5; i = i + 1) {
  print i;
}
```

Under the hood, this desugars to a mix of **variable declaration**, **while** checks, and **increment** steps. But it’s more convenient for short loops.

---

## 6. **Print: `print`**

The simplest I/O Lox provides out of the box. Just:

```lox
print "Hello from Lox!";
```

This compiles to bytecode, calling an internal `OP_PRINT` instruction in CoreLox. Perfect for debugging or casual output.

---

## 7. **Switch / Case / Default: `switch`, `case`, `default`**

CoreLox extends standard Lox with a `switch` statement, letting you compare an expression against multiple **cases**:

```lox
var fruit = "apple";

switch (fruit) {
  case "apple":
    print "You picked an apple.";
    // "fall" if you want to continue to next case
  case "banana":
    print "You picked a banana.";
  default:
    print "Unknown fruit.";
}
```

If a **default** case is present, it runs if no other case matches. You can also use `fall` in a case to “fall through” to the next case.

---

## 8. **Blocks: `{ ... }`**

Whenever you see a block, it means a **new scope** for variables. This is the same block style you see in C/Java:

```lox
{
  var temp = 99;
  print temp; // 99
}
print temp; // error, temp not defined here
```

Blocks are used in functions, if statements, loops, etc.

---

## 9. **Break / Continue: `break`, `continue`**

Inside loops (like `while` or `for`), you can **exit** or **skip** the remainder of the loop body:

- `break;` ends the loop immediately.
- `continue;` jumps to the next iteration.

```lox
for (var i = 0; i < 10; i = i + 1) {
  if (i == 3) break;
  if (i == 1) continue;
  print i;
}
// prints 0, 2, stops at 3
```

---

## 10. **Return: `return`**

Use `return` in a function to pass a value back. If you omit it, the function returns `nil` by default.

```lox
fun double(n) {
  return n * 2;
}
var result = double(10);
print result; // 20
```

You can also do `return;` with no value, which implies `nil`.

---

## 11. **Expressions & Operators**

Although not a “keyword,” the Lox grammar references a variety of expressions:

- Arithmetic: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`
- Logical: `and`, `or`, `!`
- Comparison: `>`, `>=`, `<`, `<=`, `==`, `!=`

**Example**:

```lox
print (10 + 2) * 3; // 36
print !true;        // false
print 5 == 5;       // true
```

You can nest expressions in parentheses or pass them as arguments.

---

## 12. **Putting It All Together**

Here’s a small script that uses **several** keywords:

```lox
var size = 5;

fun factorial(n) {
  if (n <= 1) return 1;
  return n * factorial(n - 1);
}

for (var i = 1; i <= size; i = i + 1) {
  print i + "! = " + factorial(i);
}
```

**What’s happening?**  

1. We declare `size = 5`.  
2. Define a function `factorial(n)`.  
3. Use a `for` loop from 1 to 5, printing each factorial.  

You’ll see output:

```
1! = 1
2! = 2
3! = 6
4! = 24
5! = 120
```

---

## **Summary**

These are the **building blocks** of Lox as implemented in **CoreLox**. You’ve got:

- **`var`** for variables  
- **`fun`** for functions  
- **`if/elif/else`** for conditionals  
- **`while`, `for`** for loops  
- **`print`** for output  
- **`switch/case/default`** for branch logic  
- **`break`, `continue`** for controlling loops  
- **`return`** for function results  

From arithmetic expressions to blocks, from function calls to advanced flow control, Lox offers a flexible, readable syntax. And **CoreLox** compiles it all down to blazing-fast bytecode, run on a single-threaded VM you can study or modify at will.

Experiment with these keywords in the playground, or dive into CoreLox’s source to see how each one becomes an **opcode**. Whether you’re brand new to Lox or a seasoned C programmer, we hope this “language tour” helps you get started writing your own programs in **CoreLox**!
